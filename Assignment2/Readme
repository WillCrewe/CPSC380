About the Assignment

My code uses 3 threads to complete the task of finding the error within the given Sudoku Boards

The three threads consists of
  - Thread for finding errors within
    - Rows
    - Collumns
    - Each of the 9 Squares
    
There are functions ran for each thread being
- Square
- Collumn
- Row

Other functions include
- input_reader
  -This reads the input csv and parses it into a 2 dimensional array
- findMissing
  -This finds the missing value in the row collumn or square where the error is to be able to give a hint to the user
- errorFoundRow/errorFoundCollumn
  - These functions are ran when an error is found, doing this allows there to be multiple errors to be found simultaneously and printed out accordingly
- SquareRun
  - This function is only used to input the bounds for each of the squares within a Soduko board
  
- Main
  - Main is where the threads are initialized and joined when finished
  
  To compile and run:
  
  g++ -std=c++0x assignment2_WC.cpp -o test -pthread
  test
